WORK EXPERIENCE
11/2018 – till date | WALMART | SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT

POS Hardware Abstraction Platform: (02/2024 – till date)
What is this project?
Developed a unified middleware platform that exposes standardized APIs to control point-of-sale (POS) peripherals, including pinpads, scales, scanners, and printers. By decoupling the software layer from specific hardware drivers, the platform ensures registers are vendor-agnostic, allowing clients to swap hardware components seamlessly without core code changes.
Why this project is important to Walmart?
Mission-Critical Retail Infrastructure:
I lead and worked on a high-scale POS hardware abstraction layer that drives operational efficiency across 5,000+ Walmart locations in the US and Canada. By decoupling hardware from proprietary vendor software, the project has achieved massive cost savings through fee elimination. Operating at a scale of 50,000+ endpoints, the system is architected for maximum uptime and reliability, as it sits in the critical path of store revenue—where downtime carries a projected fiscal impact of up to $100M daily.

My Contributions:
•	Architected and optimized MMS dashboards, reducing latency and boosting adoption, enabling proactive issue detection and faster resolution across all teams.
•	Designed and launched context-aware MMS alerting, reducing false positives by 40% and restoring on-call team confidence through deduplication with Overwatch and Spotlight.
•	Led automation of wave-level deployment validation, integrating health checks into CICD and saving 30% validation time while meeting Auto CRQ compliance.
•	Drove code quality by achieving 95%+ test coverage and zero Sonar vulnerabilities in 15+ repositories, enforcing strict PR quality gates.
•	Engineered a fully automated CICD pipeline with one-click rollback, test/hotfix flows, and multi-client support, eliminating manual steps and improving deployment reliability.
•	Delivered a self-service deployment tool for lower environments, reducing staff engineer workload by 50% and empowering developers to manage deployments independently.
•	Enabled auto-healing by architecting real-time device heartbeat and error event pipelines, improving system reliability and reducing MTTR by 25%.
•	Provided effective leadership during major organizational changes, ensuring uninterrupted delivery, successful feature launches, and high team morale.


End-to-End Assortment Orchestration Platform : (11/2018 – 01/2024)
What is this project?
Developed a mission-critical platform that integrates Machine Learning (ML) recommendations into the merchant workflow to optimize product assortments. I architected the downstream automation pipeline that transforms finalized merchant plans into actionable data—triggering automated item creation within catalog platforms and generating Purchase Orders (POs) to streamline supplier logistics and ensure on-time delivery.
Why this project is important to Walmart?
Time-to-Market Optimization & Operational Agility:
This automation platform serves as a critical driver for merchant efficiency, significantly reducing manual planning cycles and allowing merchants to focus on high-value strategic initiatives. By streamlining the product lifecycle, the project achieved a 50% reduction in time-to-market—dropping from 40 weeks to just 20. This accelerated "speed-to-shelf" provides Walmart with a decisive competitive edge, enabling the company to respond faster to market trends and directly driving accelerated revenue growth.

My Contributions:
•	Leading a team of 8 engineers to design, develop, and deliver cutting-edge assortment system, consistently meeting project deadlines and exceeding business expectations.
•	Coached and mentored team members, resulting in 1 promotion and set 3 members in line for promotion.
•	Designed and delivered a multi-tenant workflow management system which is used in automating supplier onboarding, item creation, purchase order creation for store and e-commerce business.
•	This implementation has streamlined the entire selection process for merchants, saving time and effort while saving the company approximately 5 million dollars per year.
•	Enhanced operational efficiency by creating utility tools and comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, resulting in a 30% reduction in engineering touch time.
•	Cultivated a culture within the team that values risk-taking, learning from mistakes, and mutual support, resulting in a 25% increase in overall productivity.
•	Collaborate with product, business and cross functional teams to understand product roadmaps, prioritize engineering efforts and deliver high quality solutions on time.
